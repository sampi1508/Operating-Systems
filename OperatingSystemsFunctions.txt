An operating system manages the resources of your computer.
Without an operating system, your computer would just be
a really expensive paperweight.

An operating system uses different methods of user data protection, 
like the implementation of password on the user's account, and 
other files or programs.

An operating system can run different types of programs, 
these can be either added by the user or by default on
the OS installation. Once it runs the program, it makes sure
to use the necessary resources in order to run it efficiently.
